note of fastai's course

Resources, FAQs, links, further discussion, videos, etc about each week's lecture. And here is the google drive for transcripts of lessons (with thanks to Lin Crampton), and a page of all of the course notes (with thanks to Brad Kenstler).

Lesson 0 - The "surprise lecture" during the data institute launch. It was an introduction to convolutions and machine learning for computer vision
Lesson 1 - Getting started with deep learning tools for computer vision
Lesson 2 - The basic algorithms underlying deep learning
Lesson 3 - Review of the components of a CNN; avoiding over-fitting and under-fitting
Lesson 4 - Convolutions and SGD gradient tutorials; State farm: learning rate selection, data augmentation tuning, pseudo-labeling and knowledge distillation; Intro to collaborative filtering
Lesson 5 - Adding batchnorm to VGG; visualizing latent factors; functional API; NLP and word embeddings; Multi-size CNNs; RNN introduction
Lesson 6 - MixIterator for pseudo-labeling and combining validation/training sets; Embedding Excel examples; RNNs (creating layers by hand in keras; sequence and stateful RNNs; simple RNN in Theano)
Lesson 7 - CNN architectures: resnet, inception, fully convolutional net, multi input and multi output nets; localization with bounding box models and heatmaps; using larger inputs to CNNs; building a simple RNN in pure python; Gated recurrent units (GRUs), and how to build a GRU RNN in theano
